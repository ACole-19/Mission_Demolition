# Mission_Demolition
Project 2
Added 6 levels instead of 4, which allows for the player to be slowly introduced to different material types. The wood has the lightest mass and is the easiest to break, but it can also act as a hindrance. The stone is heavier than the wood but can still be moved with a bit of effort. The jelly is completely unmovable and will rocket projectiles away if hit at the wrong angle.
